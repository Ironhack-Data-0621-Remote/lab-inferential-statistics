Hypothesis testing generally uses a test statistic that compares groups or examines associations between variables.  When describing a single sample without establishing relationships between variables, a confidence interval is commonly used.\n",

This p-value is determined based on the result of your test statistic.  Your conclusions about the hypothesis are based on your p-value and your significance level. \n",

    "\n",
    "Cautions About P-Values\n",
    "Caution SignYour sample size directly impacts your p-value.  Large sample sizes produce small p-values even when differences between groups are not meaningful.  You should always verify the practical relevance of your results.  On the other hand, a sample size that is too small can result in a failure to identify a difference when one truly exists. \n",

    "Average ages were significantly different between the two groups (16.2 years vs. 16.7 years; p = 0.01; n=1,000). Is this an important difference?  Probably not, but the large sample size has resulted in a small p-value.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Average ages were not significantly different between the two groups (10.4 years vs. 16.7 years; p = 0.40, n=10). Is this an important difference?  It could be, but because the sample size is small, we can't determine for sure if this is a true difference or just happened due to the natural variability in age within these two groups.\n",
    "If you do a large number of tests to evaluate a hypothesis (called multiple testing), then you need to control for this in your designation of the significance level or calculation of the p-value.  For example, if three outcomes measure the effectiveness of a drug or other intervention, you will have to adjust for these three analyses."

Therefore, when you do not find evidence against the null hypothesis, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

When presenting the results of a hypothesis test, include the descriptive statistics in your conclusions as well.  Report exact p-values rather than a certain range.
