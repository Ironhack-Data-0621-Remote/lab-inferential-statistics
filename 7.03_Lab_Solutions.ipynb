    "Hypothesis testing is a form of inferential statistics that allows us to draw conclusions about an entire population based on a representative sample. When you estimate the properties of a population from a sample, the sample statistics are unlikely to equal the actual population value exactly. For instance, your sample mean is unlikely to equal the population mean. Differences that you observe in samples might be due to sample error rather than representing a true effect at the population level. The difference between the sample statistic and the population value is the sample error."
